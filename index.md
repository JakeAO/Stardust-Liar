## The Premise

The world is winding down. Infrastructure crumbles faster than it can be repaired. The lights flicker more often than they shine. And everyone knows the truth they won't say out loud: this is the slow collapse.

You're not special. You're just another survivor trying to scrape by in a place where hope rusted out years ago. Maybe you're a scavenger, a fixer, someone with useful skills but no prospects. Maybe you had a better life once, before everything fell apart. It doesn't matter now.

What matters is that you've got a job. A dangerous one. The kind that pays well because most people who try it don't come back.

Welcome to the dying days. Try not to join them.

## Atmosphere

- **Gritty Realism:** Rust, decay, and failing systems define daily life
- **Desperate Survival:** Resources are scarce, trust is scarcer
- **Flickering Hope:** Small victories in a world that's falling apart
- **Noir Tone:** Morally gray choices, hard-won compromises, and the weight of consequences

## System

This campaign uses a narrative RPG system focusing on character-driven storytelling. See the [Info section]({{ "/info/" | relative_url }}) for rules and resources.
