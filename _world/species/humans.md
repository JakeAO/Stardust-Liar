**Homeworld:** Earth (mythic) / multiple settled worlds

**Population:** Vast majority of known sapient life

**Lifespan:** 70-110 years (varies by region and augmentation)

**Reputation:** *"Everywhere, in every job, in every argument."*

## Physical Characteristics

Humans are biologically diverse but broadly uniform: upright bipeds with two arms, two legs, and a wide range of skin tones, hair types, and facial features. Most live comfortably in standard station and planetary environments, with minor adaptations and cybernetics common in high-tech regions.

## Culture & Society

There is no single human culture. Instead, there are thousands, shaped by planet, station, faction, and history. Humans are adaptable to a fault, quick to build communities, and just as quick to fracture them. Cooperation and conflict are both human constants.

## History

Human history is the history of the settled systems. The Coalition rose on human ambition and labor, and its collapse reshaped human society more than any other species. Humans now occupy every niche from corporate dynasties to pirate crews to frontier homesteads.

## Presence in the System

Humans are the dominant species in the galaxy by a huge margin. Wherever there is breathable air, artificial gravity, or a ship with a working reactor, there are humans. They fill the seats of power, run most of the trade, and define the political boundaries that everyone else has to navigate.

## Abilities & Traits

- **Adaptability:** Humans thrive in wildly different environments with minimal adjustment.
- **Social Range:** They form complex communities and institutions, for better or worse.
- **Persistence:** Humans are stubborn survivors, capable of enduring long odds.

## Relationship with Other Species

Most other species define themselves in relation to humans, simply because humans are everywhere. Some see them as allies or employers, others as colonizers or oppressors, and many as both. Humans tend to be pragmatic in their relationships, but their sheer numbers often make those relationships feel lopsided.

*"They're humans. If you've met one, you've met one. If you've met a thousand, you've still only met a thousand."*
