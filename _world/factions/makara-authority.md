# Makara Planetary Authority

**Location:** Makara Prime (Sector 4)

**Status:** Nominally independent planetary government; actually run by the Makara Mining Consortium

**Reputation:** *"Democracy is expensive. Oligarchy is efficient."*

## Overview

The Makara Planetary Authority is what happens when corporations stop pretending they don't run the government. After the Coalition's collapse, the Makara Mining Consortium simply bought the planetary assembly outright. Now they wear both hats—corporate executives during the day, government officials at night.

## How It Works

- **Governor Thane Makara** is both CEO of the Mining Consortium and elected governor (in elections nobody pretends are legitimate)
- The planetary assembly consists of twelve seats, all held by consortium executives or family members
- Labor laws, environmental regulations, and safety standards have been "streamlined" to maximize efficiency
- Protests are legal but violently discouraged by corporate security forces with government authorization

## Life on Makara Prime

- **Workers:** Live in company housing, buy from company stores, work in company mines
- **Debt Bondage:** Most workers are in debt to the company and can't legally leave until debts are paid (which never happens)
- **Security:** Company/government forces patrol the streets, enforce curfews, and suppress "labor agitation"
- **Exports:** Makara Prime produces 30% of the sector's refined metals, all at the cost of worker exploitation

## Underground Resistance

Small resistance cells exist, trying to organize workers and smuggle off-world journalists onto the planet. The Authority crushes them systematically. Most resistance members end up in "extended contracts" in the deep mines.

## Relationship with Players

Makara Prime needs supplies and transport. They pay well—with strict conditions. Don't ask questions, don't talk to workers, deliver on time. Break the rules and you'll be detained for "interfering with planetary security."
