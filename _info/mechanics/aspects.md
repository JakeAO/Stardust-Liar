# Character Aspects

Aspects are phrases that describe something important about your character. They're the heart of FATE Condensed and crucial in Stardust Liar.

## What Are Aspects?

Aspects are true statements about your character, the world, or a situation. Examples:

- ***Ex-Military Pilot with a Suspended License***
- ***I Owe the Harkan Syndicate***
- ***Never Leave Crew Behind***
- ***This Station is Falling Apart***
- ***Desperate Times Call for Desperate Measures***

## Types of Aspects

### Character Aspects
Permanent traits on your character sheet:
- **High Concept:** Who you are (e.g., *Cynical Freighter Pilot*)
- **Trouble:** Your complications (e.g., *Wanted by Makara Security*)
- **Additional Aspects:** Three more defining traits

### Situation Aspects
Temporary aspects on scenes:
- ***Smoke-Filled Cantina***
- ***Syndicate Patrol Approaching***
- ***Life Support Failing***

## Using Aspects

### Invoke for Benefit (+2 or reroll)
Spend a fate point to:
- Add +2 to a roll
- Reroll all dice
- Example: "I invoke ***Ex-Military Training*** to shoot accurately"

### Invoke for Effect
Spend a fate point to make something true:
- Example: "I invoke ***Connections on Rust Haven*** to know someone here"

### Compel for Complications
GM offers you a fate point to accept a complication:
- GM: "Because you're ***Wanted by Makara Security***, those guards recognize you. Accept a fate point?"
- You: Accept the complication and the fate point, or pay a fate point to refuse

## Aspect Style in Stardust Liar

- Create interesting complications

Examples:
- ***The Harkan Syndicate Owns My Debt***
