# Harkan Station

**Location:** Sector 7, Primary Trade Hub

**Population:** ~50,000 permanent, 10,000+ transient

**Control:** Harkan Syndicate

**Reputation:** *"Expensive, corrupt, and absolutely essential."*

## Overview

Harkan Station is the beating heart of Sector 7 commerce. Every trade route passes through here. Every major transaction happens here. And the Harkan Syndicate controls every credit that changes hands.

The station is a paradox: dangerous but orderly, corrupt but reliable. The syndicate runs things with brutal efficiency. As long as you pay your fees and follow their rules, you can do business here. Cross them, and you'll wish you'd stayed in the outer sectors.
