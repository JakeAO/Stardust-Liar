title: Jaxx "Wrench" Kovar
topic: NPCs
summary: Freelance mechanic and smuggler operating in Sector 7
---

**Role:** Independent ship mechanic and part-time smuggler

**Age:** 34

**Reputation:** *"She can fix anything. Legally or otherwise."*

## Appearance

Jaxx is covered in engine grease, always. Short dark hair, practical jumpsuit with too many pockets, mechanical arm (left, custom-built by her). She carries tools everywhere and has a habit of tinkering with whatever's nearby while talking.

## Personality

Cynical but reliable. Gruff exterior hiding genuine care for her friends. Doesn't trust authority figures (especially Harkan Syndicate enforcers). Values competence and honesty—lie to her once and you're done.

She'll help if you're genuine, but she won't work for free unless you're desperate.

## Background

Former Coalition military engineer who got dishonorably discharged for "unauthorized modifications" to military hardware. She punched her commanding officer after he ordered her to sabotage life support on a civilian station (because it was harboring "dissidents").

She's been freelancing ever since, doing legitimate repairs and "creative solutions" to pay the bills. The Harkan Syndicate tolerates her because she's useful. She tolerates them because she has to.

## What She Wants

- **Independence:** Keep working on her own terms
- **Good Work:** Fix things right, not fast

*"I can fix your ship. Whether you deserve it fixed is another question."*
