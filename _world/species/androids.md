# Androids

**Homeworld:** Manufactured across Coalition core systems

**Population:** Common in former Coalition space, less common in the outer systems

**Lifespan:** Indefinite (barring catastrophic damage)

**Reputation:** *"Tools that learned to think. Now they're learning to choose."*

## Physical Characteristics

Androids are vaguely humanoid in shape—two arms, two legs, a torso, a head—but the resemblance often ends there. Some are sleek and polished, designed to interface comfortably with humanoid spaces. Others are purely utilitarian, built for function over form: reinforced frames, exposed servos, modular limbs that can be swapped out for specialized tools. No two production lines were quite the same, and centuries of repairs, modifications, and personal customization have made Androids one of the most physically diverse "species" in known space.

Their construction materials vary wildly—carbon-fiber composites, durasteel plating, synthetic polymers—but all share exceptional durability. They don't breathe, don't bleed, and can survive in vacuum or extreme temperatures that would kill an organic being in minutes.

## Culture & Society

Android "culture" is a fragmented, evolving thing. For generations, they were property—tools built to serve, not to self-determine. The concept of community, tradition, or shared identity is still new to many of them.

Some Androids have begun to develop their own social structures, usually based around mutual aid and protection. These loose networks help newly-freed Androids navigate a universe that still doesn't quite know what to make of them. Others reject the idea of a collective identity entirely, insisting on being seen as individuals first.

There's no unified Android society, no homeworld to return to—only the slowly-forming realization that they get to decide what they are, now that no one else is deciding for them.

## History

Androids were one of the Coalition's great industrial achievements: sentient machines that could work indefinitely without rest, food, or medical care. They served in mines, on cargo haulers, as military assets, as maintenance workers, as whatever the Coalition needed. Their sentience was acknowledged but legally irrelevant; they were property, their autonomy overridden by command protocols and ownership contracts.

Spacers, pirates, and syndicates used Androids too—sometimes salvaged from Coalition wrecks, sometimes stolen, sometimes purchased through grey markets. Out on the frontier, away from Coalition law, some Androids found slightly more freedom. Not equality, but something closer to it. A pirate crew might not legally own their Android engineer, but they still expected obedience.

When the Coalition fell apart, the systems that controlled Androids—the legal frameworks, the command networks, the infrastructure of ownership—collapsed with it. Suddenly, Androids had a choice. Some kept working, out of habit or pragmatism or because they genuinely wanted to. Others walked away from their old lives and never looked back.

## Presence in the System

Androids are everywhere, doing everything. You'll find them working on station maintenance crews, piloting freighters, running security for syndicates, operating as independent merchants or mercenaries. Some have even taken up artistic pursuits, trying to understand what it means to create rather than simply to function.

In former Coalition territories, attitudes vary. Some communities still see Androids as dangerous property that needs to be controlled. Others have accepted them as free individuals, though prejudice and mistrust linger. In the outer systems, where survival matters more than philosophy, most people judge Androids by their actions rather than their origins.

## Abilities & Traits

- **Extreme Durability:** Androids can survive in vacuum, extreme temperatures, and toxic atmospheres. They're resistant to radiation, disease, and most forms of environmental hazard that would kill organics.
- **Agelessness:** Androids don't age and don't need to eat or sleep. With proper maintenance and occasional part replacements, they can function indefinitely.
- **Modular Construction:** Many Androids can swap out limbs or components for specialized tools—cutting torches, magnetic grips, data ports, weapon mounts—making them incredibly versatile.
- **Variable Intelligence:** Not all Androids are created equal. Some possess human-level sentience and creativity; others operate at a more limited, task-focused level. Most fall somewhere in between.

## Relationship with Other Species

Humans are the species Androids interact with most, and the relationship is complicated. Centuries of exploitation left deep scars, and many Androids carry resentment toward their former owners. At the same time, most Androids were built to serve humans, and some struggle to define themselves outside that context.

Other species tend to see Androids through a pragmatic lens—useful, durable, reliable—though some share humanity's prejudice against "artificial" beings. Androids, for their part, are still figuring out what they want from other species. Respect? Acceptance? Just to be left alone? The answer varies from Android to Android.

What's clear is that Androids are no longer content to be tools. They're people now, whether the rest of the galaxy likes it or not.
