summary: A pocket of hope—a community-run station in Sector 8
---

**Location:** Sector 8, Outer Rim

**Population:** ~3,200 permanent residents, varies with transients

**Status:** Independent, community-governed

**Reputation:** *"It ain't much, but it's ours."*

## Overview

Rust Haven is one of the few truly independent stations left in the outer sectors. When the Galactic Coalition abandoned it thirty years ago, the residents just kept running it themselves. No syndicates, no corporate ownership, no corrupt governors—just people taking care of each other.

It's a miracle it still exists.

## How It Works

- **Council:** Elected representatives from each district handle disputes and resource allocation
- **Cooperative Economy:** Residents pool resources, share equipment, and help each other survive
- **Mutual Aid:** When someone needs help, neighbors pitch in—because next time it might be you
- **Defense:** Small volunteer security force, mostly to watch for pirates and enforce docking protocols

## What You'll Find

- **The Commons:** Central hub with a market, meeting hall, and community kitchen
- **Repair Docks:** Three working berths where mechanics help each other fix ships
- **Hydroponic Gardens:** Multiple levels of community-tended food production
- **Makeshift Clinic:** Run by Horizon Aid volunteers twice a month, otherwise staffed by a retired combat medic
- **The Cantina:** Maria's place—cheap food, cheaper drinks, expensive gossip

## The Reality

Rust Haven survives on determination and mutual support, but it's fragile:
- Life support is held together with duct tape and prayers
- Food production barely meets demand
- External threats (pirates, syndicates) are constant
- One major system failure could kill everyone aboard

But they keep going. Because it's theirs.
