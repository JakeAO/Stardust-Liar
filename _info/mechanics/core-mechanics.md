Stars Without Number uses a mix of 2d6 skill checks and d20 combat rolls, combining OSR-style danger with modern skill-based gameplay.

## The Core Roll: 2d6 + Skill + Attribute

Most non-combat actions use **2d6 + skill level + relevant attribute modifier**.

- Roll **8+** for typical difficulty
- Roll **10+** for challenging tasks
- Roll **12+** for very difficult tasks

**Example:** Hacking a security terminal
- Roll 2d6 + Program skill (level 1) + Intelligence modifier (+1) = 2d6+2
- Need 10+ to succeed

## Attributes

Six core attributes, each with a modifier:

- **Strength (STR):** Physical power and melee combat
- **Dexterity (DEX):** Agility, reflexes, and ranged combat  
- **Constitution (CON):** Health and endurance
- **Intelligence (INT):** Logic, technical skills, and knowledge
- **Wisdom (WIS):** Perception, intuition, and mental fortitude
- **Charisma (CHA):** Social influence and leadership

**Attribute Modifiers:**
- 3: -2 modifier
- 4-7: -1 modifier  
- 8-13: +0 modifier
- 14-17: +1 modifier
- 18: +2 modifier

## Skills

Skills range from level 0 (trained) to level 4 (mastery).

- **Level 0:** Basic training, no penalty
- **Level 1-4:** Increasing expertise (+1 to +4)
- **Untrained:** -1 penalty to the roll

### Common Skills
- **Combat:** Punch, Shoot, Stab
- **Technical:** Fix, Program, Pilot
- **Social:** Connect, Lead, Trade
- **Knowledge:** Know, Notice, Sneak

## Combat

Combat uses **d20 + bonuses vs. Armor Class (AC)**.

### Attack Roll
Roll **d20 + Attack Bonus + Skill Level + Attribute Modifier**
- Warriors add their level to attack rolls
- Hit if the total meets or exceeds the target's AC

### Damage
Roll weapon damage (e.g., 1d8 for a laser pistol) on a hit.

### Initiative  
Roll **1d8 + DEX modifier** at the start of combat.

## Saving Throws

When facing danger, roll a **d20** against your save target:
- **Physical:** Resist toxins, disease, physical effects
- **Evasion:** Dodge explosions, traps, area attacks
- **Mental:** Resist psychic powers, fear, mind control

Roll equal to or higher than your save value to succeed.

## Hit Points

HP represents luck, stamina, and minor wounds. At 0 HP, you're mortally wounded and need immediate medical attention.

- Most characters start with 1d6 + CON modifier HP
- Warriors and other classes may have more
- Combat is deadly—retreat when necessary

- Completing missions
