# Horizon Aid Collective

**Type:** Volunteer humanitarian organization

**Area of Operations:** Sectors 5-9 (the "Forgotten Sectors")

**Reputation:** *"They actually give a damn."*

## Overview

The Horizon Aid Collective is a loose network of volunteer doctors, engineers, and supply runners trying to keep the outer sectors alive. They operate aging medical ships and supply transports, delivering food, medicine, and repair parts to stations and colonies that everyone else abandoned.

They're perpetually understaffed, underfunded, and overworked. They keep going anyway.

## Operations

- **Medical Ships:** Three medical frigates provide free healthcare to stations without clinics
- **Supply Runs:** Regular food and medicine deliveries to struggling colonies
- **Station Repairs:** Engineering teams help maintain life support and water systems on failing stations
- **Refugee Transport:** Evacuate people from stations that can't be saved
- **Training:** Teach locals basic medical care and equipment maintenance

## Funding

Horizon Aid runs on donations, grants from sympathetic planetary governments, and occasional support from the remaining Coalition remnants. Most of their equipment is secondhand or jury-rigged. They make it work.

## Leadership

**Dr. Amara Chen** founded Horizon Aid twenty years ago after watching a station die from a preventable disease outbreak. She's in her sixties now, still running operations from the medical ship *Second Chance*. Known for being fierce, compassionate, and absolutely unwilling to give up on anyone.

## Volunteers

Most volunteers are:
- Ex-military medics who couldn't walk away
- Engineers who prefer fixing things to profiting from them  
- Pilots who need to feel useful
- People who lost someone and want to help others survive

## Relationship with Players

Horizon Aid needs transport, supplies, and protection. They can't pay market rates, but they offer medical care, repairs, and contacts throughout the outer sectors. Most importantly, they're one of the few organizations out here that actually tries to help.
