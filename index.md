Welcome to **Stardust Liar**, where survival means navigating the corrupt, patchwork remains of a galaxy that forgot you existed.

- Explore [Rules & Info]({{ "/info/" | relative_url }}) for Stars Without Number mechanics and cheat sheets
- Discover the [Galaxy]({{ "/world/" | relative_url }}) – its factions, characters, and forgotten corners
- Read [Session Logs]({{ "/sessions/" | relative_url }}) documenting your crew's desperate maneuvers

## The Premise

You're broke. You're desperate. And you're stuck in the ass-end of charted space where nobody gives a damn if you live or die.

The Galactic Coalition fell apart decades ago, leaving behind a patchwork of corrupt planetary governments, syndicate-controlled sectors, and forgotten trade routes. The only law out here is what you can enforce yourself. The only help comes from volunteer aide fleets stretched impossibly thin, trying to keep dying stations operational and food shipments moving.

You're crew on a rusted transport, bouncing between stations, taking whatever work keeps the ship flying and your bellies full. Maybe you're a pilot with a suspended license. Maybe you're ex-military who saw too much. Maybe you're a drifter who never had a choice. Whatever brought you here, one thing's certain: you're not getting out.

But you keep going. Because that's what you do in the trash bin of space.

## Atmosphere

- **Gritty Survival:** Every credit matters, every repair is temporary, every system is held together with duct tape and hope
- **Corrupt Authority:** Planetary governors answer to syndicates, station security looks the other way, and "law" means whoever has the biggest guns
- **Rare Hope:** Volunteer medics keeping clinics open, mechanics sharing spare parts, strangers helping strangers when no one else will
- **Cynical Realism:** No heroes, no chosen ones—just people trying to survive another day in a galaxy that doesn't care

## Setting

**Star Wars meets Cowboy Bebop** in the forgotten edges of space:
- Dusty spaceports with flickering lights and broken ventilation
- Syndicate enforcers collecting "protection fees" at docking bays
- Volunteer aide ships distributing food to station residents
- Black markets where you can buy anything if you know who to ask
- Run-down cantinas where information flows faster than the cheap liquor

## System

This campaign uses **Stars Without Number: Revised Edition**, a sandbox sci-fi RPG system combining OSR-style mechanics with modern character creation, deadly combat, and tools for procedural sector generation. See the [Info section]({{ "/info/" | relative_url }}) for rules and resources.
