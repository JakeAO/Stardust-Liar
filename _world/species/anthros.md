title: Anthros
topic: Species
---

**Homeworld:** Various worlds across former Coalition space

**Population:** Extremely rare

**Lifespan:** Varies by base species (typically 40-80 years)

**Reputation:** *"A ghost story that sometimes walks through your door and asks for a drink."*

## Physical Characteristics

Anthros are anthropomorphic animals—creatures that blur the line between beast and person. They stand upright, possess hands capable of tool use, and have vocal anatomy that allows for human speech, but they retain the fundamental features of their base species: claws or hooves, tails, ears, snouts, and all the sensory capabilities that come with them.

A fox Anthro might have sharp senses of hearing and smell, digitigrade legs built for speed, and expressive ears that betray their emotions. An ursine Anthro might possess immense strength and a heavily-built frame that makes them intimidating even when they're trying not to be.

Each Anthro is unique, their exact anatomy depending on what animal lineage they emerged from. The only commonality is that they all possess the physical adaptations necessary for sapient life: hands, speech, and a brain capable of abstract thought.

## Culture & Society

There is no Anthro culture, because Anthros don't form communities. They're too rare, too scattered, and they don't reproduce. An Anthro born to a pack of wolves on a frontier colony world will never meet another Anthro in their lifetime, unless they travel far and get very lucky.

Most Anthros are raised by their animal parents—until their human-like nature becomes impossible to ignore. Some are abandoned when they start asking questions their parents can't understand. Others are cared for as long as possible, until the gap between animal and sapient becomes too wide to bridge. A few are taken in by human settlements early, but integration is difficult when you're the only one of your kind.

As a result, Anthros tend to be cultural chameleons, adapting to whatever society they find themselves in. Some integrate seamlessly into human or alien communities. Others remain perpetual outsiders, never quite fitting in anywhere. Many carry traces of their animal upbringing—instincts, mannerisms, behaviors that mark them as different even when they're trying to blend in.

## History

Nobody knows exactly when or where Anthros first appeared. The prevailing theory is that they're the result of Coalition genetic experiments gone wrong—or gone right, depending on your perspective. Somewhere in the depths of Coalition research stations, scientists were testing genetic modifications on animals. Maybe they were trying to create something: smarter beasts of burden, biological weapons, living terraforming tools. Maybe it was just reckless experimentation for its own sake.

Whatever the cause, the modifications escaped into the wild. They weren't immediately obvious—an altered gene here, a modified sequence there, dormant traits waiting for the right combination to express. Most of the time, nothing happened. But every now and then, an animal is born with human-like intelligence and the physical capacity to use it.

The Coalition never took credit for Anthros, and most of the research records were lost when the Coalition fell. All that remains are theories, rumors, and the occasional Anthro born to confused and terrified animal parents.

## Presence in the System

Anthros are rare enough that most humans have heard of them—frontier legends, curiosity pieces, the subject of holotape documentaries—but few have actually met one. They're scattered across human space, living wherever they can find a place for themselves.

Some work on stations or ships, valued for their unique combination of animal senses and human intelligence. A canine Anthro might work security, using their sense of smell to detect contraband. A feline Anthro might be a scout or infiltrator, combining human cunning with animal stealth. Others avoid settled space entirely, living on the fringes or going deep into unexplored regions where questions about their origins are less likely to come up.

The few Anthros who become known tend to leave an impression—not just because of their appearance, but because they've had to fight harder than most to carve out a place in a universe that wasn't built for them.

## Abilities & Traits

- **Enhanced Senses:** Depending on their base species, Anthros often possess superior hearing, smell, night vision, or other sensory abilities far beyond human norms.
- **Physical Adaptations:** Claws, fangs, natural armor, or enhanced strength and agility give many Anthros a physical edge in dangerous situations.
- **Hybrid Instincts:** Anthros retain some of their animal instincts—territorial behavior, pack mentality, predator/prey responses—which can be an asset in survival situations but sometimes complicates social interactions.
- **Sterility:** Anthros cannot reproduce. Whatever genetic quirk created them also prevents them from effectively breeding.

## Relationship with Other Species

Humans' reactions to Anthros range from fascination to fear to outright hostility. Some see them as miracles of science or tragic victims of Coalition experiments. Others view them as abominations, unnatural things that shouldn't exist. Most just don't know what to make of them—they're too rare to generate consistent social norms around.

Anthros, for their part, often have complicated feelings about their existence. Many struggle with identity—are they the animal they were born as, or the person they became? Some embrace their uniqueness; others wish they could be truly one thing or the other. Few have the luxury of meeting another Anthro to compare experiences with.

What's universal is that Anthros are survivors. They've had to be. Born into a world that has no category for them, raised by parents who couldn't fully understand them, living in a society that doesn't know where they fit—they endure anyway.
