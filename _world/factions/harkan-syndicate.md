title: The Harkan Syndicate
topic: Factions
summary: Ruthless crime organization controlling most of Sector 7
---

**Control:** Sector 7 (including Harkan Station, three mining colonies, and multiple trade routes)

**Reputation:** *"Pay up or ship out—preferably both."*

## Overview

The Harkan Syndicate is the dominant criminal organization in Sector 7, having filled the power vacuum left when the Galactic Coalition withdrew. What started as protection rackets on Harkan Station has grown into a sprawling operation controlling trade, mining, and even local governance across multiple systems.

## Operations

- **Protection Fees:** Every ship docking at Harkan Station pays. Every merchant operating in Sector 7 pays. No exceptions.
- **Mining Rights:** The syndicate "licenses" mining operations on asteroid colonies, taking a 60% cut of all extracted materials
- **Black Market:** Runs the largest gray-market operation in three sectors, selling everything from medical supplies to restricted weapons
- **Enforcement:** Maintains a fleet of patrol ships and armed enforcers at every major port

## Leadership

**Kella Harkan** runs the syndicate with cold efficiency. She took over from her father fifteen years ago and has systematically eliminated competitors. Known for being brutally practical—she'll negotiate if it makes financial sense, but cross her once and you're done.

*"The Coalition had laws. Harkan has rules. At least with Harkan, you know where you stand."*
