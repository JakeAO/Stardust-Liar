## Tactical Tips

1. **Use Cover:** Always seek cover when in a firefight
2. **Coordinate:** Focus fire on single targets
3. **Know When to Run:** Retreat before you're all at 0 HP
4. **Suppress First:** Pin enemies before advancing
5. **Conserve Ammo:** Burst fire is powerful but burns through magazines
6. **Aim When Safe:** +1 to hit is valuable if you have time
