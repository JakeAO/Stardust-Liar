summary: Founder of Horizon Aid, stubborn humanitarian
---

**Role:** Founder and Director of Horizon Aid Collective

**Age:** 63

**Reputation:** *"She won't give up on you even when you've given up on yourself."*

## Appearance

Dr. Chen looks tired. She always looks tired. Grey hair pulled back in a practical bun, worn medical scrubs under a patched jacket, and the kind of exhaustion that comes from caring too much for too long.

But her eyes are fierce. They say: "I've seen the worst this galaxy has to offer, and I'm still here."

## Personality

Stubborn. Compassionate. Relentless.

Dr. Chen believes people deserve help just for being people. She's seen stations die from preventable diseases, watched governments abandon colonies, and treated refugees nobody else would touch. Twenty years ago, she decided someone had to care.

She's direct, often blunt, and has no patience for bureaucracy or excuses. But if you're hurting, she'll move heaven and earth to help you.

## Background

Dr. Chen was a Coalition military surgeon before the collapse. She watched a civilian station in Sector 8 die from a plague outbreak because no one would send medicine. After that, she left the military, sold everything she owned, bought a medical frigate, named it "Second Chance," and started Horizon Aid.

Twenty years later, she's still running supply missions, treating patients, and training volunteers. She should have retired a decade ago. She won't.

## What She Wants

- **Save Lives:** Treat the sick, feed the hungry, help the desperate
- **Build Networks:** Train locals to help themselves
- **Prove a Point:** People matter, even when governments say they don't

*"I've got three medical ships, seventeen volunteers, and five thousand people who need help. So no, I can't take a day off."*
