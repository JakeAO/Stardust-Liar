Creating a character for Stardust Liar follows the Stars Without Number process with some campaign-specific flavor.

## Step 1: Roll Attributes

Roll **3d6** for each attribute in order (or use point-buy if your GM allows):
- Strength
- Dexterity  
- Constitution
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma

Calculate modifiers for each:
- 3: -2 modifier
- 4-7: -1 modifier
- 8-13: +0 modifier
- 14-17: +1 modifier
- 18: +2 modifier

## Step 2: Choose a Background

Backgrounds represent your life before the campaign. Each grants:
- Free skill levels in 2-3 skills
- A quick-pick skill option
- Background-specific benefits

### Backgrounds That Fit Stardust Liar
- **Spacer:** Born on stations and ships, comfortable in zero-G
- **Technician:** Worked maintaining dying infrastructure  
- **Criminal:** Survived by breaking the law
- **Soldier:** Served in military or mercenary units
- **Merchant:** Traded goods across corrupt sectors
- **Vagabond:** Drifted from place to place, never settling

## Step 3: Choose a Class

Select from the core classes:

### Warrior
Combat specialists with high HP and superior attack bonuses.
- **Best for:** Fighters, guards, enforcers
- **HP:** 1d6+2 per level
- **Combat:** Add full level to attack rolls and damage

### Expert  
Skill masters who excel at non-combat challenges.
- **Best for:** Pilots, mechanics, hackers, traders
- **HP:** 1d6 per level
- **Skills:** Reroll any failed skill check once per scene

### Psychic
Possess psionic powers through mental disciplines.
- **Best for:** Mind readers, telekinetics, precognitives
- **HP:** 1d6 per level  
- **Powers:** Access to psychic disciplines and techniques

### Adventurer
Multiclass option combining two classes (partial benefits from each).

## Step 4: Pick Skills

- Your background gives you starting skills
- You have additional picks based on your class
- You can improve existing skills or learn new ones
- Level 0 in a skill means you're trained (no penalty)

### Key Skills for Stardust Liar
- **Pilot:** Flying ships through dangerous space
- **Fix:** Keeping aging equipment operational
- **Shoot:** Staying alive in firefights
- **Program:** Hacking systems and bypassing security
- **Connect:** Finding contacts and gathering information
- **Trade:** Negotiating deals and spotting scams
- **Notice:** Spotting danger before it's too late

## Step 5: Choose a Focus

Foci are special abilities that define your unique capabilities. Choose one at level 1.

### Useful Foci for the Campaign
- **Armsman:** Better with weapons and armor
- **Starfarer:** Expert spacer and pilot
- **Tech Specialist:** Master of technical systems
- **Die Hard:** Harder to kill, more HP
- **Connected:** Know people everywhere
- **Alert:** Never surprised, better initiative

## Step 6: Buy Equipment

Start with 600 credits. Priorities:
- **Weapon:** Laser pistol (200cr) or shotgun (50cr)
- **Armor:** Armored clothing (50cr) or woven body armor (100cr)
- **Tools:** Compad (50cr), repair kit (25cr)
- **Survival:** Rations, medkit, spare parts

### Campaign Note
Most starting characters in Stardust Liar are broke, desperate, and using second-hand gear. Your equipment should reflect that reality.

## Step 7: Final Details

- **Name:** What do people call you?
- **Description:** What do you look like? How do you carry yourself?
- **Background:** Where are you from? What brought you here?
- **Goal:** What are you trying to achieve? What keeps you going?
- **Connection:** How do you know the other PCs? Why do you trust them?

## Campaign-Specific Considerations

In Stardust Liar:
- You're broke and desperate—start with minimal resources
- The galaxy is corrupt—connections and reputation matter
- Technology is aging—Fix skill is invaluable
- Violence is common—combat skills keep you alive
- You're crew—decide how you met and why you stick together
