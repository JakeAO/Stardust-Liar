# Kella Harkan

**Role:** Syndicate Boss, de facto ruler of Sector 7

**Age:** 42

**Reputation:** *"She doesn't threaten. She promises."*

## Appearance

Kella dresses in expensive but practical clothing—tailored jackets, reinforced boots, minimal jewelry. Everything about her appearance says "professional." She carries a custom blaster on her hip, not for show. Her office in Harkan Station's Crown district is austere: a desk, a few chairs, and a wall of screens showing station operations.

## Personality

Cold. Calculating. Efficient.

Kella didn't inherit the syndicate because of her name—she earned it by being better than every competitor. She's not cruel for cruelty's sake; she's brutal because it works. She'll negotiate fairly if you bring value. She'll eliminate you without hesitation if you become a problem.

People describe her as "reasonable" and "terrifying" in the same sentence.

## Background

Took over the Harkan Syndicate at 27 when her father was assassinated by a rival gang. Within two years, she'd eliminated every rival, expanded operations into three new sectors, and turned the syndicate from a criminal enterprise into the de facto government of Sector 7.

She's never married, has no known family, and trusts exactly three people (all syndicate lieutenants who've proven their loyalty repeatedly).

## What She Wants

- **Control:** Maintain dominance in Sector 7
- **Profit:** Expand operations where profitable
- **Stability:** Chaos is bad for business
- **Respect:** Not love, not fear—respect for what she built

*"I don't need you to like me. I need you to pay your fees and do your job. Everything else is negotiable."*
